Hi I'm Ramkumar a dedicated SAP ABAP Consultant with a strong interest in building user-friendly SAP solutions from ALV reports and Smart Forms to data migration using BDC.
I enjoy optimizing processes and solving problems with effective code. 
With a background in Civil Engineering and a desire to learn, I'm excited to advance in the SAP ABAP and contribute to meaningful projects.
I have started leaning the new syntax and i will be saving my workouts and projects in this repository.
